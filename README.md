# The robust vehicle routing problem with synchronisation

The data provided in this repository concerns the Robust Vehicle Routing Problem With Synchronisation (Robust VRPSync) and serves as supplementary material for the publication:
- Soares, R., Parragh, S.N., Marques, A., & Amorim, P. (2025). The robust vehicle routing problem with synchronisation: models and branch-and-cut algorithms. *Networks*. Submitted for publication.

The repository contains the following files:
- Folder 'instances': contains instance files for the VRPSync, which can be used for the Deterministic and Robust VRPSync; they were adapted and modified from the instances from Solomon (1987).
- Folder 'results': contains the results obtained from the computational experiences performed in Soares et al. (2025).
